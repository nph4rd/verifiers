"""
Protocol: Defines how multiple agents interact in a multi-agent environment.

A Protocol specifies turn order and agent interaction patterns, separate from
the task/environment logic. This allows the same protocol (e.g., round-robin)
to be reused across different tasks.

Example protocols:
- RoundRobinProtocol: Agents take turns in order (player_0 → player_1 → ...)
- SimultaneousProtocol: All agents act at once (future)
- HierarchicalProtocol: Some agents coordinate others (future)
